## Daily Standup

### Format

Each team member answers:

2. What will I work on today?
3. Do I have any blockers?

### Anti-patterns to Avoid

|--------------|-----------------|
| Status report to manager | Team sync |
| Solving problems in standup | Take offline |
| Going over 15 minutes | Keep it short |
| Only talking to Scrum Master | Talk to team |
| Sitting down | Stand up (energy) |

### Virtual Standup Tips
