# Memory System

This directory contains persistent knowledge for the MUSUBI project.

## Purpose

The memory system stores accumulated knowledge across conversations:

- **architecture_decisions.md** - ADR-style decision records
- **development_workflow.md** - Common workflows and processes  
- **domain_knowledge.md** - Business domain understanding
- **suggested_commands.md** - Frequently used commands
- **lessons_learned.md** - Insights and improvements

## Usage

Agents read from these files at the start of each conversation and update them when new knowledge is discovered.

## Maintenance

Review and update these files regularly to keep knowledge current.
